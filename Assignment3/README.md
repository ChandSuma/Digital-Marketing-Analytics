Description - 

In this assignment, we are provided with a Generated Dataset to  analyse the Effects of Ad Spending on TV & Radio. And whether
or not these mediums have any AdStock Effects or not. 

We Explain few Concepts related to AdStock and Marketing Mix Modeling in the Assignment Notebook. 

Dataset consists of features like Sales, TVSales, TVRadio Sales, Adstock Values for 2 models and Period is in Weeks. 
We also have TV and Radio Spending o Advertisements for each week. 
We are also given a Temperature information which can be used to model seasonality. 


You can Run the Steps described below to View/Replicate the outcome of the tasks. 


1. This is the original Dataset file provided - 'Adstock_TV_Radio_Sales.csv'

2. Run the Jupyter notebook - 'Marketing_Mix_Model_AdStock_Analysis.ipynb' 

3. This notebook includes the Univariate Analysis and Multivariate Analysis. Then we model the Adstock effects using Marketing Mix Modeling 
 in 2 ways 
 - Linear Regression using Ordinary Least Squares method
 - Numerical Approximation Method
 
 
4. Use the output generated - 'MMM_Adstock_TV_Radio_Modeling.csv'
We uploaded this to salesforce Einstein Analytics and Created An App > Dataset > DataFlow > Dashboard
